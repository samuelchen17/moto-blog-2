add AI to check if post or comment is appropriate?

urgent - delete post success, edit post success etc. different alerts for user feedback

if submit fails, do not clear form - post?

bundle comments and author call?

dash post accordion, dropdown info for, accordion or stacked for mobile view?
-author
-updated at
-how many comments

whole dash ui refactor

check all db connections, current loading times is far too long, move backend to vercel?

# event

a tab for user dash events, where they can see what events they have signed up to etc? also for them to leave event, manage and see events

sort event by event date rather than creation date?

join events - also show capacity, display if event full

# profile page

Hover over user card

# fix all alerts?

# dash post accordion?

dropdown info for author updated at
how many comments etc.

future thought, messaging between users, forum page?

display name?
modal for popup changing email and password
interceptor for fake admin account

# better route implementation

/posts/{postId}/delete?userId={userId}

# comment manager and event manager for user

# fix dash tables

- only refresh table body when data updates
